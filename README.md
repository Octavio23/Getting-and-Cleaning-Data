# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

In the run_analysis.r script get the information and merge into a data frame, all the observations, activities and subjects, then i work only with the columns that have the mean and the std of the activities, since the activity data stay with a key i change with the description of the activity also i change the names of the fields to make it easy to understand and finaly i consolidate the data by activity and subject fields applying the function col_means to all data except activity and subject.
